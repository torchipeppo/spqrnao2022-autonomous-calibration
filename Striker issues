1) Fix InWalkKick: given that we have to walk through the ball, we risk hitting it with the other foot (and we usually do it). NaoDevils for example just use a longer step (they rewrote the WalkEngine from scratch).
2) Check for oscillations between behaviors
3) Avoiding teammates or not?
4) Sometimes more than one striker (hysteresis in the coordinator)
5) Threshold precision vs speed tradeoff: adjusting thresholds?
6) Two states for ball carrier realignment with different tuned parameters
